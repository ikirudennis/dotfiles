Role Name
=========

For graphical environments, I have a bunch of apps whose configurations I'd
like to track. At this time, bundling them all into one `graphical` role seems
like a good solution. In the future, I may end up splitting them out into
separate roles for each application, but that feels a little like overkill at
the moment.
